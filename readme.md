# Trip planner

Quick app for laying out different trips and trip options.

Let's say you are considering flying to Amsterdam, but the flights on Saturday are more expensive than on Friday.
However, then you need to book one night less - how much will that cost total?

Trip planner to rescue - add different options (Saturday/Friday) and different Segments to those options (fligths out and accomodation). Add prices. See clear differences. Or at least that's the idea.

It's also just fun to test the v0.dev chatgpt thingy.
