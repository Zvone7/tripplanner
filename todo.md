I want you to

add a specialized currency dropdown on frontend (component) that will display both character and short_name. currencies will be alphabetically (short _name) sorted and can be searched for. auto select user's preferred currency if set, otherwise default to EUR.
add this dropdown both to user_preference view (where they can choose default time zone) and to the segment create/edit view, right next to the price
when a user is seing total cost, it should be displayed in their preferred currency.
each trip should also have a default currency - this is auto populated by user default when creating the trip. the preferred currency view can be also set on options and segments view.

add a way for user to edit currency conversion on admin view
